A Consolidated list of resources needed to replicate statistical results

In the folder listed original data are all the initial datasets used as sources to create the completed dataset, as well as a translated version of one of the datasets. The completed dataset can be found in the completedata folder, the CleanData is the data which is primarily used. The folder for R-scripts contains 8 Separate scripts that each are related to a specific task, two of these are related to the compiling and synchronisation of datasets, and the remaining are separated into scripts dedicated to running regressions, creating tables, and creating graphs. In the folder marked as WVS the reader will find a compiled datasett based on world value survey rounds 3-6, along with a script that creates the graphs and tables found in the mechanism section of the empirical analysis. 

Should anything be missing, or not working, please contact me and I will attempt to remedy the issue.
